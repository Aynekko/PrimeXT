If you want to create a new page or edit an existed, see `docs` subdirectory. All pages located there and structured by language and semantically. 
Pages are written with Markdown, which is pretty simple and convenient language. For convenient working with it, you can use Visual Studio Code. 
Adding or editing documentation pages is straightforward: just read next section "Installation".

After doing everything that described in there: you'll get opened browser window with entire documentation site. 
Also, all of your changes in Markdown pages will be immediately shown in browser.

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation
First of all, for working with all this stuff you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), if you haven't.
Next, make sure that your working directory is `/documentation`, and in 'Windows Terminal' or 'Command Prompt' execute command below (it'll install all necessary packages)

```
npm ci
```

So, this command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
```
npm run start
```
